  This project aims to implement the way neuron(in a neural network) works using multithreading and semaphores.As it is shown in the structure of the layers that make up a neuron, we see its job can be divided between 4 different kinds of threads Two of which are assigned to read files including weights and inputs of a neuron.In this project it is assumed that the number of weights and inputs in each row is constant.(128)
  There are multiple threads as middle threads which calculate the results of multiplication of weights and inputs two by two.The number of these threads are dynamic and are passed to the program via the args when running the ./neuron file.
 The final thread's job is to accumulate the results passed by the middle threads and then sum up it with the bias given in the weights file.Finally, it appends the result to the outputs.txt file.
 To answer the question that How this project works as a multithreaded program, It should be said that there is kind of a pipeline view of multithreading that has been applied in this implementation.It means that whenever the inputs has been calculated in the middle threads it is permitted that the input thread gets new values from the next row and also middle threads can start the job when the inputs are ready.
 As for the connection between middle threads and the output thread ,it is needed to allow the output to accumulate the result when they are completely calculated in the middle threads and middle threads can begin a new calculation when the outputs are appended to the main resulat in the output thread.
 To control the shared variables between threads, There are two by two semaphores between middle threads and input threads and also such semaphores between middle threads and output thread.Semaphores are applied to keep control of the order the jobs are done to have any prerequisties required for each action.
 Note that the inputs are distributed between middle threads so as to have 128/(number of middle threads) for each thread and the last middle thread also gets the remainder.
That was the whole logic that this project is based on using concepts of semaphores, threads and pipeline methods.
